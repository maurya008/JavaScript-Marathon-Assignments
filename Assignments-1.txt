1) Explain the use of JavaScript ( or What you can do using a JavaScript)

=> JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex feature on web pages.
	it enables you to create dynamically updating content controls multimedia, animate images and pretty much everything like,
	Browser, mobile, backend, desktop, APIs, Cloud, Typescript, machine learning DSA, Blockchain.

2) What is the difference between client-side and server-side?

=> Code running in the browser are know as client-side code and is primarily concerned with improving the appearance and 
behavior of a rendered web page. This includes selecting and styling UI components, creating layouts, navigation, form validation, etc.
Server-side programming is very useful because it allows us to efficiently deliver information tailored for individual users and thereby create a much better user experience.
Companies like Amazon use server-side programming to construct search results for products, make targeted product suggestions based on client preferences and previous buying habits, simplify purchases, etc.
Client-side web frameworks simplify layout and presentation tasks while server-side web frameworks provide a lot of "common" web server functionality that you might otherwise have to implement yourself 
(e.g. support for sessions, support for users and authentication, easy database access, templating libraries, etc.).

3) What is Nodejs?

=> Node.js is a cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to build server-side and network applications with JavaScript.

4) Explain Scope in JavaScript?

=> A function serves as a closure in JavaScript, and thus creates a scope, so that (for example) a variable defined exclusively within the function cannot be accessed from outside the function or 
   within other functions. For instance, the following is invalid:
		function exampleFunction() {
    		var x = "declared inside function";  // x can only be used in exampleFunction
    		console.log("Inside function");
    		console.log(x);
		}

		console.log(x);  // Causes error

5) JavaScript is asynchronous or synchronous.

=> JavaScript is a synchronous.

6) JavaScript is Single-threaded or Multi-threaded.

=> Javascript is a single threaded language. This means it has one call stack and one memory heap. As expected, it executes code in order and must finish executing a piece code before moving onto the next.

7) Explain DOM in your own word.

=> The Document Object Model (DOM) is the data representation of the objects that comprise the structure and content of a document on the web. The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents.
   It represents the page so that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes and objects; that way, programming languages can interact with the page.
